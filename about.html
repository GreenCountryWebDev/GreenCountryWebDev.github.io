                <h2>About The Company</h2>
                <p>
                    I started this company because I know there's a better way for 
                    companies to grow their online presence. A website adds credibility 
                    and increases the visibility of your company. A good website helps 
                    customers find your business anytime, anywhere and builds your brand. 
                    A modern, simple website provides quality information for your customers 
                    in a reliable way. This will save you time and allows you to showcase products
                    and services in a simple and cost effective way. With proper construction a website 
                    can expand your market or help your exposure in an existing market. You can also 
                    add a Frequently Asked Questions section to your website to help educate consumers 
                    and save time that would be used conducting customer service duties.
